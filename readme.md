# Abhishek Garg

Founder · Systems Architect · Behavioral Infrastructure

I build systems that model behavior, not just user interaction.

15+ years in software engineering.
Currently formalizing behavioral modeling through academic psychology research.

Building **Echoes of Mind** — a signal-based emotional intelligence platform.

## Mission

Most mental health products optimize retention.

I am building systems that optimize awareness.

Instead of tracking moods, I design infrastructure that:

* Detects behavioral shifts across rolling time windows
* Triggers insights only when statistically meaningful patterns emerge
* Reduces notification noise instead of amplifying it
* Preserves user agency through architecture, not policy

The goal is clarity at scale.

## Core System: Behavioral Signal Engine

A modular detection engine designed to process longitudinal behavioral data.

**Capabilities**

* Rolling window analysis (24h / 7d / 30d)
* Frequency spike detection
* Volatility and intensity modeling
* Behavioral clustering (e.g., night activity patterns)
* Signal deduplication and cooldown enforcement
* Event-based insight triggering
* AI-assisted interpretation separated from core logic

**Architecture**

* NestJS modular backend (service-isolated detectors)
* Prisma schema-first modeling
* Indexed MySQL data layer
* Redis-backed throttling & caching
* Cron-driven scheduled execution
* Device lifecycle-aware push pipeline
* Token lifecycle management with dedup safeguards

Design principle:
No insight without signal. No signal without threshold.

## Production Engineering Discipline

Beyond behavioral modeling, I architect compliance-driven SaaS systems.

**Systems Designed To Handle**

* Province/state-based regulatory rules
* Role-scoped RBAC matrices with granular permissions
* Deterministic business rule engines
* Scheduled reporting (PDF/CSV generation via cron orchestration)
* Environment-parity Docker deployments
* Cost-aware cloud deployment strategies
* Secure auth flows with access/refresh lifecycle management

I prioritize:

* Schema governance
* Deterministic logic separation
* Failure-mode anticipation
* Long-term maintainability

Architecture is a commitment, not an experiment.

## Engineering Principles

* Engagement is not improvement.
* Push notifications are system interrupts, not marketing tools.
* AI must be bounded by architecture.
* Behavioral datasets require structural integrity.
* Delete complexity before adding features.

---

## Measurable Focus

* 15+ years production software experience
* Modular backend architectures serving multi-domain systems
* Signal detection designed for longitudinal scaling
* Cron-based automation layers in production
* RBAC systems with permission matrices (not role shortcuts)
* Full Dockerized dev/prod parity pipelines
* CI-driven deployment workflows

Building for a 10-year horizon, not quarterly feature velocity.

---

## Long-Term Direction

* Privacy-preserving behavioral datasets
* Pattern-aware emotional infrastructure
* Signal-based insight delivery
* Scalable architecture that holds under millions of data points

The moat is not UI.
The moat is structured behavioral modeling.
